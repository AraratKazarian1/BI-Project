# DS206: Business Intelligence Group Project 2

This project is a Business Intelligence (BI) group project focusing on the creation of relational and dimensional data pipelines. The relational pipeline is designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) raw data from an Excel file into an SQL Server database. The data pipeline is implemented using Python and tools such as PyODBC and Pandas for data manipulation.
